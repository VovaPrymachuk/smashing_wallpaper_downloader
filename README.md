# smashing_wallpaper_downloader
A command line interface (CLI) utility that downloads all wallpapers in the desired resolution for the specified month and year into the user's current directory

There is a website called Smashing Magazine, which uploads wallpapers for the desktop each month. It's not efficient to manually visit the site every month and check for new content, so let's automate this task.

# run command
ruby smashing.rb —-month 022018 —-resolution 640x480
